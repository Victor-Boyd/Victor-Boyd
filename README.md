# Victor - Fullstack Robotics Engineer
## About Me
Hi, I'm Victor, a Fullstack Robotics Engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions for the automation industry. I specialize in designing and developing both the hardware and software aspects of robotics.
## Current Project
Currently, I'm working on a project called Cavalla, where we're focused on automating heavy machinery and transforming the industry.
## Current obsession
Visual odometry is what I am most interested in at the moment as it has the potential to be much more accurate than commonly used methods such as wheel odometry with encoders with less cost!
